# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
Week-7-Challenge

## Overview of Project:
### Resources: 
- Data Sources:  departments.csv, dept_emp.csv, dept_manager.csv, employees.csv, salaries.csv, titles.csv
- Software: SQL, PostgreSQL, pgAdmin

### Purpose:
The following analysis consists of providing detailed information for Pewlett Hackard, the company is conducting an examination on the number of employees, their roles, and what department they are currently in. This analysis will provide the company with a concrete goal for future planification. Upcoming, we can observe the breakdown of the analysis performed


## Results:
- Using the diagram below, the Database was mapped out in order to have a further understanding of the data that will compose the analysis. This step can be more challenging than it seems, for this purpose, we were given directions on how the layout should be performed. Mapping out the database is one of the most crucial steps since it is a visual representation of the data layout. 

   ### See Image 1 (DataBase Layout) attached below:

- Once the data was extracted properly, a proper "cleaning" was performed. This consisted of disregarding the duplicated data, some of the employees appeared multiple times, which could hurt the outcome of our analysis. After the data was properly cleaned, we began by organizing the data sets into their respective orders/categories aka. titles, employee number, gender, and hiring date to name a few.  

   ### See Image 2 (Data Extraction) attached below:

 - Another point of interest is acknowledging the number of employees that will be retiring in the upcoming years. This is a main point of interest since we want to anticipate future hirings to help account for future planning. It looks like human resources will have lots of work in the coming years. 
 
   ### See Image 3 (Retiring Employees by Title)

 - Another key point of the analysis embodies a list of candidates that can qualify to become a part of our mentorship program, these employees can be referenced  as senior employees among others. This is a great tool to help find those future mentros and leaders of the company.  


## Summary:

- After completing the analysis we concluded that currently our "silver tsunami" or employees soon to retire account for almost 65% of the current staff. As seen in Image 3 (Retiring Employees by Title), we can observe with a concrete idea the number of employees per title soon to retire. 

- We can now determine eligibility for future mentorship from a list of current employees that could qualify based on senior status, we have enough workforce to sustain  mentorship for future employees. As well as an extensive hiring task in the upcoming years.
